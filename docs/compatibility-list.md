# Capatibility list
In Skywalking, each monitored component/framework will have a unique identifier. because of the publish time and publish version for the Skywalking main project and nodejs project is not one by one corresponding. So some monitored component/framework identifier are not recognized by the Skywalking Collector, it will cause some problems on the UI.

So you have two way to resolve this problem. One is **download the capatiblity version** and the other way is **add your own component library setting**.
